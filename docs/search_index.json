We can generate this county-level dataset by simply changing the geography argument in the get_decennial function, and specifying state=\"CO\". We’ll assign this county-level population dataset for Colorado to a new object called CO_county_population_2010: # Generate dataset with information on population by county in Colorado, and assign to an object named &quot;CO_county_population_2010&quot; CO_county_population_2010&lt;-get_decennial(geography = &quot;county&quot;, state=&quot;CO&quot;, variables = &quot;P001001&quot;, year = 2010) # View dataset View(CO_county_population_2010) GEOID NAME variable value 08023 Costilla County, Colorado P001001 3524 08025 Crowley County, Colorado P001001 5823 08027 Custer County, Colorado P001001 4255 08029 Delta County, Colorado P001001 30952 08031 Denver County, Colorado P001001 600158 08035 Douglas County, Colorado P001001 285465 "],["basic-data-cleaning-and-manipulation-with-dplyr.html", "3 Basic data cleaning and manipulation with dplyr 3.1 Renaming and deleting columns 3.2 Modifying columns 3.3 Subsetting Data 3.4 Creating new variables", " 3 Basic data cleaning and manipulation with dplyr Once data has been pulled into R Studio via tidycensus, it’s possible to work with data using the entire suite of data analysis tools available through the tidyverse. Among other things, we can use tidyverse tools to clean up, modify, or explore the census datasets that we retrieve using tidycensus. 3.1 Renaming and deleting columns 3.1.1 The rename and select functions Let’s clean up the dataset of Colorado’s 2010 population distribution with respect to counties that we just created in the previous section (CO_county_population_2010). As a reminder, the first few rows of that dataset look like this: View(CO_county_population_2010) kable(head(CO_county_population_2010, n=6)) GEOID NAME variable value 08023 Costilla County, Colorado P001001 3524 08025 Crowley County, Colorado P001001 5823 08027 Custer County, Colorado P001001 4255 08029 Delta County, Colorado P001001 30952 08031 Denver County, Colorado P001001 600158 08035 Douglas County, Colorado P001001 285465 Let’s remove the “variable” field, and rename the “value” field as “Population”. We can perform these operations by using functions from the dplyr package, which is a part of the tidyverse. We can use the select function to remove the “variable” field, and the rename function to rename the name of the field containing the population data from “value” to “population”. We’ll use the pipe operator (%&gt;%) to chain together these functions, which allows us to perform both of these cleaning operations in one block of code; we’ll assign the revised dataset to a new object named CO_county_population_2010_cleaned: # Takes &quot;CO_county_population_2010&quot;, deletes the &quot;variable&quot; column, renames the &quot;value&quot; column as &quot;population&quot;, and assigns this modified dataset to a new object names &quot;CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&quot; CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&lt;-CO_county_population_2010 %&gt;% select(-variable) %&gt;% rename(population=value) Let’s view the dataset to ensure that these changes have been implemented: View(CO_county_population_2010_cleaned) GEOID NAME population 08023 Costilla County, Colorado 3524 08025 Crowley County, Colorado 5823 08027 Custer County, Colorado 4255 08029 Delta County, Colorado 30952 08031 Denver County, Colorado 600158 08035 Douglas County, Colorado 285465 Note that the select function can either be used to directly delete columns from a dataset (if these columns are preceded by a -) or alternatively, to designate the columns to keep (which will delete the residual columns). So, for example, the following syntax would also effectively delete the variable column, and rename the value column: # Takes &quot;CO_county_population_2010&quot;, deletes the &quot;variable&quot; column (using slightly different syntax than above), renames the &quot;value&quot; column as &quot;population&quot;, and assigns this modified dataset to a new object names &quot;CO_county_population_2010_cleaned_alternate&quot; CO_county_population_2010_cleaned_alternate&lt;-CO_county_population_2010 %&gt;% select(GEOID, NAME, value) %&gt;% rename(population=value) Let’s check to make sure that CO_county_population_cleaned_alternate looks the same as CO_county_population_cleaned above: View(CO_county_population_2010_cleaned_alternate) GEOID NAME population 08023 Costilla County, Colorado 3524 08025 Crowley County, Colorado 5823 08027 Custer County, Colorado 4255 08029 Delta County, Colorado 30952 08031 Denver County, Colorado 600158 08035 Douglas County, Colorado 285465 3.2 Modifying columns 3.2.1 Columns and string operations Note that the “Name” column in our cleaned county-level dataset of the Colorado population contains names in the format “ County, Colorado”. What if we want to edit this, such that we replace the “NAME” column with a new column named “County”, which contains simply the name of the county (i.e. &lt;“County Name”&gt; instead of &lt;“County Name&gt; County, Colorado”&gt;)? To do so, we can use the mutate function to create a new column named “County”, and then populate this column with the string that results from removing “County, Colorado” from the “NAME” column; then, we can go ahead and remove the “NAME” column. Below, instead of assigning this modified dataset to a new object, we’ll simply assign it back to CO_county_population_2010_cleaned, which overwrites that object’s existing contents with these changes: # Take the &quot;CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&quot; dataset, create a new variable named &quot;County&quot; that takes the information in the &quot;NAME&quot; column and removes the part of the string that contains &quot;County, Colorado&quot;, and then remove the now superfluous &quot;NAME&quot; column CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&lt;-CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% mutate(County=str_remove(NAME, &quot; County, Colorado&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-NAME) # View &quot;CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&quot; (Note that only the first six records are printed in this guide) View(CO_county_population_2010_cleaned) GEOID population County 08023 3524 Costilla 08025 5823 Crowley 08027 4255 Custer 08029 30952 Delta 08031 600158 Denver 08035 285465 Douglas 3.2.2 The relocate function It’s worth noting that we can use the relocate function to reorder a dataset’s columns to our specifications. For example, note that currently, the population column is sandwiched between “GEOID” and “County”; what if we prefer that the “population” column is the last column in the dataset? We can change the column order using the relocate function, and specify the desired relative position of a given column using either the .before or .after argument: CO_county_population_2010_cleaned&lt;-CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% relocate(population, .after=County) View(CO_county_population_2010_cleaned) GEOID County population 08023 Costilla 3524 08025 Crowley 5823 08027 Custer 4255 08029 Delta 30952 08031 Denver 600158 08035 Douglas 285465 Note that if neither the .before nor .after arguments are specified within the relocate function, the column that is passed to relocate will automatically be moved to the front of the dataset (i.e. it will be the first column). 3.3 Subsetting Data 3.3.1 The filter function dplyr also allows us to easily subset census data retrieved from tidycensus. Let’s say, for example, that we want to select only those counties in CO_county_population_2010_cleaned that have a population greater than 100,000. To do so, we can specify this condition with the appropriate logical operator within the filter function. We’ll assign this subsetted data to a new object named CO_large_counties: CO_large_counties&lt;-CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% filter(population&gt;100000) Now, let’s view our newly created table of Colorado counties with a population of greater than 100,000: View(CO_large_counties) GEOID County population 08031 Denver 600158 08035 Douglas 285465 08041 El Paso 622263 08069 Larimer 299630 08059 Jefferson 534543 08077 Mesa 146723 08101 Pueblo 159063 08123 Weld 252825 08001 Adams 441603 08005 Arapahoe 572003 08013 Boulder 294567 Note that the table is not arranged in order, with respect to the population. Let’s reorder the dataset’s rows, in descending order with respect to the population variable (such that the most populous county appears in the first row): CO_large_counties&lt;-CO_large_counties %&gt;% arrange(desc(population)) View(CO_large_counties) GEOID County population 08041 El Paso 622263 08031 Denver 600158 08005 Arapahoe 572003 08059 Jefferson 534543 08001 Adams 441603 08069 Larimer 299630 08013 Boulder 294567 08035 Douglas 285465 08123 Weld 252825 08101 Pueblo 159063 08077 Mesa 146723 If we want to arrange the dataset in ascending order with respect to the population (such that the least populous county appears on top), we can use the following: CO_large_counties&lt;-CO_large_counties %&gt;% arrange(population) View(CO_large_counties) GEOID County population 08077 Mesa 146723 08101 Pueblo 159063 08123 Weld 252825 08035 Douglas 285465 08013 Boulder 294567 08069 Larimer 299630 08001 Adams 441603 08059 Jefferson 534543 08005 Arapahoe 572003 08031 Denver 600158 08041 El Paso 622263 It is also possible to filter based on text; for example, if we want to extract the record for Denver, we could use the following (note the double equal sign in the expression): CO_large_counties %&gt;% filter(County==&quot;Denver&quot;) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## GEOID County population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 08031 Denver 600158 Note that above, we didn’t assign this subsetted record to it’s own object, but we could have easily done so. Below, let’s subset Denver and Boulder counties, and assign these records to a new object, named denver_boulder: denver_boulder&lt;-CO_large_counties %&gt;% filter(County==&quot;Denver&quot;|County==&quot;Boulder&quot;) View(denver_boulder) kable(denver_boulder) GEOID County population 08013 Boulder 294567 08031 Denver 600158 Note the syntax above; the code that reads filter(County==\"Denver\"|County==\"Boulder) specifies that we want to pull out all records where the “County” column takes on the value “Denver” OR (denoted by the |) “Boulder”. While filter is the most common function used to subset data according to specified criteria, there are others that come in handy as well. 3.3.2 slice functions It is often useful to extract rows with particularly high or low values for a given variable. This is where the slice functions of dplyr can come in handy. Let’s say we want to extract the county with the largest population in the CO_county_population_2010_cleaned dataset; we can do so by passing the “population” variable as an argument to the slice_max function: CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% slice_max(population) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## GEOID County population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 08041 El Paso 622263 If we don’t want the single largest county by population, it is easy to extract records with the “n” largest values of a variable by specifying n as an argument. For example, if we wanted the four most populous counties, we would specify n=4 after the population argument: CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% slice_max(population, n=4) ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## GEOID County population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 08041 El Paso 622263 ## 2 08031 Denver 600158 ## 3 08005 Arapahoe 572003 ## 4 08059 Jefferson 534543 The slice_min function is analogous to the slice_max function, but extracts the rows associated with the “n” smallest values of a variable. For example, the code below extracts the 8 smallest counties by population (note that unlike in the slice_max example, we’ll assign the resulting subset to a new object, named CO_counties_8smallest): CO_counties_8smallest&lt;-CO_county_population_2010_cleaned %&gt;% slice_min(population, n=8) View(CO_counties_8smallest) GEOID County population 08111 San Juan 699 08079 Mineral 712 08053 Hinsdale 843 08057 Jackson 1394 08061 Kiowa 1398 08017 Cheyenne 1836 08033 Dolores 2064 08115 Sedgwick 2379 3.4 Creating new variables "],["grouping-operations-and-summary-statistics.html", "4 Grouping operations and summary statistics", " 4 Grouping operations and summary statistics "],["elementary-visualization.html", "5 Elementary Visualization", " 5 Elementary Visualization "],["advanced-data-retrieval.html", "6 Advanced data retrieval", " 6 Advanced data retrieval https://mattherman.info/blog/tidycensus-mult-year/ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
