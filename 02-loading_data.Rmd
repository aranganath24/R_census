# (PART) Decennial Census {-}

# Basic Data Retrieval

## Load table of variables

We begin by loading a table of decennial census variables, and assigning it to an object named ```decennial_variables```:

```{r}
decennial_variables<-load_variables(2010, "sf1")
```

We can print this table to the console by simply printing the object name, ```decennial_variables```:

```{r}
# Print table of 2010 decennial variables to console
decennial_variables
```

To view this table in R Studio's data viewer, pass the object to the ```View``` function:

```{r}
View(decennial_variables)
```

When the data is open in the R Studio data viewer, it will look something like this:

```{r, fig.cap="Table of 2010 census variable descriptions and codes", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/pic1.png")
```

## Query the census API, and retrieve data using tidycensus

Now, let's generate a table of population by state, based on the 2010 decennial census, and assign this new dataset to an object named ```state_population_2010```:

```{r}
state_population_2010<-get_decennial(geography = "state", 
                                     variables = "P001001",
                                     year = 2010)
```

As with our table of variable descriptions (```decennial_variables```), we can view the data by typing the object name, which prints its contents to the console:

```{r}
state_population_2010
```

Recall that we can also bring up the data in the R Studio data viewer using the ```View``` function:

```{r}
View(state_population_2010)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(state_population_2010, n=6))
```

## Modify a census API call by altering arguments to the "get_decennial" function

Let's say that instead of a dataset that contains the population for each state (based on the 2010) census, we want a dataset that contains the population for each county in the state of Colorado. We can generate this county-level dataset by simply changing the ```geography``` argument in the ```get_decennial``` function, and specifying ```state="CO"```. We'll assign this county-level population dataset for Colorado to a new object called ```CO_county_population_2010```: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Generate dataset with information on population by county in Colorado, and assign to an object named "CO_county_population_2010"
CO_county_population_2010<-get_decennial(geography = "county", 
                                         state="CO",
                                         variables = "P001001", 
                                         year = 2010)

# View dataset
View(CO_county_population_2010)
```

```{r, echo=F}
kable(head(CO_county_population_2010, n=6)) 
```
